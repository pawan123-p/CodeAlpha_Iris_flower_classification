# Iris Flower Classification 
**CodeAlpha Data Science Internship Project**

#  Project Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning project to classify the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their physical measurements. It is a foundational project in Data Science that demonstrates the implementation of a classification model using Python.

# Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier)
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

# About the Dataset
The model is trained on the classic Iris dataset (`iris.csv`). The dataset includes four input features (measurements in centimeters):
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

The target variable is the **Species** of the flower.
